							<p>Starboard is a multiplayer game where players team up as airship crews and sink eachother.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>Starboard was developed as a university assignment under a time period of three months.
                                <br>My roles during development were mostly, but not limited to:
                                <br>* <a href="#LeadEngineer">Lead Engineer</a>
                                <br>* <a href="#LeadNetworkEngineer">Lead Network Engineer</a>
                                <br>* <a href="#TechnicalArtistAnimator">Technical Artist/Animator</a>
                            </P>
                            <p>
                                Below follows a quick writeup showcasing some of the more interesting notes from development, aswell as my personal thoughts during the project.
                            </p>

                                An interesting issue encountered early one was synching player characters positions and rotations client-side on all ships.
                                Ships are moved on the server, but characters might have a slight delay - and the ships can have some pretty serious 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="LeadNetworkEngineer">
                            <h3><a name="LeadNetworkEngineer">Lead Network Engineer</a></h3>
                            <p>
                                I made the decision to use a ready asset for the low-level network transport layer during pre-production, we had way to short a timeline to build our own from scratch.
                                In this regard, I decided to use the awesome asset <a href="https://mirror-networking.com/">Mirror</a>, an open-sourced community replacement for Unitys now-deprecated HLAPI (High-Level API).
                                <br>
                                Mirror is nothing short of amazing, and proved to be incredibly easy to work with - and I could easily instruct my subordinate programmers and expect them to produce decent network code in a short order.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I early on made the decision to ignore the server-authoritative pattern common in most competitive multiplayer games, this was mostly done due the Starboards' unique design making it rather hard to cheat in a constructive manner.
