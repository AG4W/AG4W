                                When a ship gets shot, there's a chance a component might be damaged - for Starboard I wanted to do something abit more involved in terms of repair rather than hitting the station with a hammer as is common in most videogames.
                                I'm a huge fan of diegeticism and immersion in games, so I decided to implement some unique minigames that works as repairs.

                                Minigames are generic prefabs that can be placed within station prefabs, and are randomly selected if there's more than one.
                                This was done as to create some variety in what needs repairs when.

                                Here are two of the minigames currently in Starboard, the first is the simple prototype where the player just needs to turn a wheel.

                                And the other is a bit more involved, it requires the player to match a couple of fluid meters to a randomized value.

                                An interesting issue encountered early one was synching player characters positions and rotations client-side on all ships.
                                Ships are moved on the server, but characters might have a slight delay - and the ships can have some pretty serious wave-action going on.

                                Characters also cannot be parented under the ship hierarchally due to networking constraints, aswell as me wanting to facilitate boarding/cross-ship character gameplay if we want to in the future.
                                So, this means a character controller with dynamic platforms, synched across the network.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The solution is simpler than I expected - our character motor uses a "local parent" to determine the gravitational direction, the groundcheck updates which object this local parent is every frame.
                                As for synching this across the network, instead of synching the actual client position - the client synchs the position <i>OFFSET</i> from the local parent, on the receiving remote client the player character thus gets the correct position regardless of network delay or misaligned ship positions.
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    Perfectly synched characters are thus achieved with this simple line of code.

                                    The following methods handles our dynamic platform movement, this controller deals with stairs, ramps, moving platforms, vehicles, odd gravitational directions and any form of collider without a hitch.
                                    Our collision detection is reactive, movement and locomotion happens first.

                                I made the decision to use a ready asset for the low-level network transport layer during pre-production, we had way to short a timeline to build our own from scratch.
                                In this regard, I decided to use the awesome asset <a href="https://mirror-networking.com/">Mirror</a>, an open-sourced community replacement for Unitys now-deprecated HLAPI (High-Level API).
                                <br>
                                Mirror is nothing short of amazing, and proved to be incredibly easy to work with - and I could easily instruct my subordinate programmers and expect them to produce decent network code in a short order.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I early on made the decision to ignore the server-authoritative pattern common in most competitive multiplayer games, this was mostly done due the Starboards' unique design making it rather hard to cheat in a constructive manner.
                                There is one area where the server is authoritative, and that is the ship locomotion - players can send data to the server that will tell them if they want the ship to move forward, back, up or down aswell as steer left and right - however, the server controls the actual vehicle position.
                                Clients will asymptotically interpolate (normal lerp without using frame deltatime) towards the known server position to avoid drift.

                                The results can be seen below.
